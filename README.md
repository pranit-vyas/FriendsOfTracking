# FriendsOfTracking

This reposiroty at aimed at sharing my learnings of the football analytics course by Friends of Tracking (FoT). You can find all of their lectures and tutorials [FriendOfTracking YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBFJYcag8j2rm_9HkrrA7w)

While the code is based on this [repository](https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD), I will also be making my own changes in reaching the final goal of the lectures.
I am just a fan of football and analytics trying to understand more of football using data
